<p>At last I could endure no longer to sit supinely by while a fellowman was dragged down to a horrible death by that repulsive reptile.<span class="digress-trigger" data-digress-trigger="footnote-1"></span> Embedded in the prow of the skiff lay the spear that had been cast after me by him whom I suddenly desired to save.  With a wrench I tore it loose, and standing upright in the wobbly log drove it with all the strength of my two arms straight into the gaping jaws of the hydrophidian.</p>

<p>With a loud hiss the creature abandoned its prey to turn upon me, but the spear, imbedded in its throat, prevented it from seizing me though it came near to overturning the skiff in its mad efforts to reach me.</p>

<p>The aborigine, apparently uninjured, climbed quickly into the skiff, and seizing the spear with me helped to hold off the infuriated creature.  Blood from the wounded reptile was now crimsoning the waters about us and soon from the weakening struggles it became evident that I had inflicted a death wound upon it.  Presently its efforts to reach us ceased entirely, and with a few convulsive movements it turned upon its back quite dead.<span class="digress-trigger" data-digress-trigger="footnote-2"></span></p>

<p>And then there came to me a sudden realization of the predicament in which I had placed myself.  I was entirely within the power of the savage man whose skiff I had stolen.  Still clinging to the spear I looked into his face to find him scrutinizing me intently, and there we stood for some several minutes, each clinging tenaciously to the weapon the while we gazed in stupid wonderment at each other.</p>

<p>What was in his mind I do not know, but in my own was merely the question as to how soon the fellow would recommence hostilities.</p>
